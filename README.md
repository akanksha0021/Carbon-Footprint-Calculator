# Carbon-Footprint-Calculator
A Python-based tool to calculate your carbon footprint, compare it with global and regional averages, and provide personalized recommendations for reducing your environmental impact.

Features
Calculate carbon footprint based on key consumption metrics
Compare your footprint with global and regional averages
Receive personalized recommendations based on your results
Detailed information about the impact and effort required for each recommendation
Available as both command-line tool and web application
User-friendly interfaces with input validation
How It Works
The calculator takes the following inputs:

Monthly electricity consumption (kWh)
Weekly distance traveled by car (km)
Weekly meat consumption (kg)
Weekly non-recycled waste (kg)
Daily water consumption (liters)
Your geographical region (optional)
Based on these inputs, it calculates:

Your carbon footprint for each category
Your total carbon footprint in metric tons of CO2 per year
How your footprint compares to global and regional averages
Whether your usage is high, moderate, or low
Personalized recommendations to reduce your carbon footprint
